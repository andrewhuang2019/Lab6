# Lab #6
## IDE, Compiled Programs (C++ Programming), Git
This lab tasked us with reading data from a file, and transforming that data to matrices.  
Functions include (in order):  
readFile - reads data from matrix_input and stores it into 2d vectors.  
printMatrix - prints the matrix in a easy to see format.  
addMatrix - adds matrix 1 and matrix 2 together, returns and prints the resulting matrix.  
multiplyMatrix - multiplies matrix 1 and matrix 2, returns and prints the resulting matrix.  
subtractMatrix - subtracts matrix 2 from matrix 1, returns and prints the resulting matrix.  
updateMatrix - updates matrix 1 with value in row and column and prints the matrix. 
maxValue - prints the max value of matrix 1. 
transposeMatrix - transposes matrix 1 and prints the matrix. 
main - runs all of the functions.
